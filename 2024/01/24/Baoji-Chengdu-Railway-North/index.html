The title means "Ice and weeds dancing on the iron brocade across Jialing River and Qinling Mountain Range" in Japanese and can be pronounced as "Kariō no Kōnishiki no Uega, Chinba no Kōriba wa Odoru". The article has been available with the same title in Mandarin on Zhihu since Jan 2024, and some of the photos may feature anti-counterfeiting marks due to the fact that have been removed from local storage when published here.

<p>The station name “Qinling”, “Guanyinshan”, “Baoji”, “Fengxian” and “Huixian” can be pronounced as “Ch’in Ling”, “Kuan Yin Shan”, “Pau Chi”, “Fong Hsian” and “Hui Hsian” respectively.</p>

<p>Baoji-Chengdu Railway is the first electrified line throughout mainland China. The line’s north section and the south witnessed the joining near Huang Sha He Village in mid-July 1956 and its operation began on the first day of 1958 after the opening ceremony which was held by He Long (the former marshal of PLA) and the first capital-express train from the metropolitan in southwest China. USSR played a critical role in the line’s layout along with electrification, and it is the line itself that is to stand the test of ages after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The first railway line connecting southwest China with northwest now carries 3 pairs of confirmed trains to travel through Qinling Mountain Range, and Jialing River, the longest of all rivers originated from the grand boundary that separates north China and the south.</p>
<p>I can hardly find chances to travel via the 67-year-old railway line as my hometown locates on Eastern China and the only chance to hear about the line can be dated back to textbooks in my senior high ages. The outcome of CCP’s <em>Plan of the first 5 years</em> finally gets into my horizon thanks to admissions from the college in Xi’an, the manipulative capital of Shaanxi Province where Baoji, one side of the railway locates. I finally obtained vacancies after Great Cold (the last one of the 24 solar terms) this year and, without hesitation, I decided to go there as a journey during the Spring Festival Traffic Peak.</p>
<p>The number of trains on the first electrified railway line in China PR has experienced a sharp decrease due to damage spelt by rainstorms in 2018 summer, as the rest of all trains on the line are instructed to bypass the north section (especially near Lüeyang) at daytime. The shortage of trains forced me to divide my trip into 2 days and I have to opt T7 (the “HeavenStar”) Train, the first train that enters the line from the north side for departure from Xi’an of both days. Train Y50½ was added to the line’s timetable at that time to make more tourists able to enjoy the winter view of the rail line, but I certainly refuse the long and boring stays in museums and parks along the line, so I dropped the thoughts regarding purchases of the Y-series trains.</p>
<h2 id="Jour-Premieres-2024-01-20-Qinling-Railway-Station-and-Lingguanxia-Canyon"><a href="#Jour-Premieres-2024-01-20-Qinling-Railway-Station-and-Lingguanxia-Canyon" class="headerlink" title="Jour Premières (2024&#x2F;01&#x2F;20): Qinling Railway Station and Lingguanxia Canyon"></a>Jour Premières (2024&#x2F;01&#x2F;20): Qinling Railway Station and Lingguanxia Canyon</h2><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Destination_Sign_Board_of_T7%2C_-8_%28Beijing_West-Chengdu_West%29%2C_Jan_20_2024.jpg" alt="Destination Sign Board of T⅞"></p>
<p>HeavenStar made a punctual departure from Xi’an at 6:02 a.m. and the time when the train leaves Baoji Railway Station chords with scheduled. The train finally arrived at Qinling Railway Station 15 minutes earlier than expected.</p>
<p>Winter vacation of primary school and junior high students has had started on this day, as it happened to be one of the days off for adult officers, making the train increasingly crowded with the before-18 and their parents, most of which are bound to get off in Qinling. Surroundings of the fourth-tier station (assessed by officials from China Railways) have experienced great improvements and service extensions conducted by governors in the past few years, attracting an increasing number of tourists. The origin of Jialing River stands few kilometres away, and many hikers prefer starting their trip from the station.</p>
<p>The HeavenStar had officially arrived at Baoji-Chengdu Railway after its passing-by at <ruby><rb>Renjiawan</rb><rt>Ren Chia Wan</rt></ruby> Railway Station. Like all trains to take challenges from the line, the train was to go through a total of 47 tunnels before its arrival at Qinling, the highest station line-wide, between which tracks feature a minimum radius of no more than 300 meters and the maximum slope of over 30‰ (meaning that the train has to climb up to the height of over 30 meters every single kilometer in that section), which has been hazardous enough to get banned by railway corporations globewide nowadays. The steep climb, thus, makes it possible for passengers and drivers to spot 2 tracks of different heights at the bottom of Guanyinshan, the beginning of the crazy curve. The succession of tunnels and bridges spell the success of the line along with flickering of the window-view, making tourists onboard exclaiming. The north side of Qinling Mountain Range can hardly gain the direct shine after sunrise, making the sceneries covered with more white snow and frost than that in the urban area of Baoji. Small crystals covering leaves throughout the mountains scattered the rest rays of light, making the train coaches even brighter. Tourists are quite surprised at the early spot of this calligraphy-like sceneries spelt by the figure of mountains and the embellishment of snows, taking out their photographing devices and turning to others to share their feelings. Immigrant workers are not exceptions - they proved to be willing to share their views and thoughts when they are back to their home with their descendants. Kids onboard kept screaming and dragged the sleeves of their parents to share their happiness, as the youngsters paused their playings on phones to take photos. The middle-aged turned their video calls on as livestreams for their families, and the aged unsurprisingly demonstrated their calmness and sophistication by expressing nothing via faces.</p>

There are 2 bridges exposed along with an exit of a tunnel in front as well as another tunnel standing at the farther (Shot on 2024/01/23)"></p>
<p>The train started to slow down upon entering the 47th tunnel. It arrived at Qinling Railway Station several minutes later.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Board_of_Tunnel_47_%28Qinling_Tunnel%29_of_Baoji-Chengdu_Railway%2C_Jan_23_2024.jpg" alt="Qinling Tunnel (Tunnel №47) is the second longest tunnel throughout the line with the length of over 2.3 kilometres"></p>
<p>HeavenStar was the best choice for the locals in Baoji to take an early snow-view of the geological dividing-line, as it stood out with a very good timetable for these 2 stations. The train arrived at Baoji with a modest time of around 8 a.m. and a perfect before-noon time of 9 to arrive at Qinling - the melting process of snow have not reached the peak at that time, as the sunrise began around 7:30 a.m. Buses and shuttles had been waiting for a long time in front of the station to pick up the passengers to museums and the Jialing origin, as they could be the only way for the visitors to avoid traffic hazards on the highways towards the attractions. Theme parks standing near the station featured literature-related exhibition center and sculptures made up of track iron.</p>

The iced cement ground was really slippery"></p>
<p>I re-entered the station after visiting these memorial sites nearby to catch the train №606¾ which will arrive at Qinling 2 hours later. All rail-workers in the station were surprised at my re-entrance and later told me the trend that I’m the only tourist that was to take the slow train to go southwards from this station.</p>
<p>“It’s very rare for a visitor to go southwards - not to mention leaving the station before noon.” They added.</p>
<p>I intended to take the quiet moment as opportunity to gain more information about the line from the officials, but got interrupted by a brand-new topic among them.</p>
<p>“When will (K)545 arrive today? I bet it will make an early arrival as well.” One of them asked.</p>
<p>“Maybe, but there’s still no calls up to now. I don’t know.” A response came out in seconds.</p>
<p>Hardly had I dug into the meanings of the so-called “<em>calls</em>“ when an electrified locomotive passed by. The Ho Hsieh 3 locomotive should be the one that had pulled HeavenStar to climb the previous mountains as an additional one.</p>
<p>Slopes of the line’s north section had been steep enough when the operation began in 1958. It’s not an exaggeration to say that it takes almost the same time for steam locomotives to climb from Guanyinshan Railway Station to <ruby><rb>Qingshiya</rb><rt>Ch’in Shi Ya</rt></ruby> with walking. To solve this problem, China Railways listed the line as the first to be electrified and only in this way can the locomotives with the capabilities of higher speeds get introduced to the steep section. An additional locomotive would be employed to pull the passenger coaches up, and 2 more locomotives were required to push the freight trains from their butts. They were once grouped as “Qinling Additional Locomotives Team” but now re-categorized into <ruby><rb>Xinfengzhen</rb><rt>Hsin Fong Chen</rt></ruby> Station Department with a new name “Qinling North Application Office”.</p>
<p>The “<em>call</em>“ finally arrived. They Qinling officers had picked up the <em>call</em> from Guanyinshan that train №K545 had passed by the foothill station already. Then they dived into preparations for the from-Harbin train’s arrival and began to broadcast the start of ticket-check, despite the fact that none of the passengers would get on that train on this day. One of the officers noticed my staring at the platform, and he asked me whether I was willing to get out of the lounge to take photos for the train, should I step off the platform, and I responded with an affirmative answer. The officer then began to share a story of a friend of his who enjoys collecting models of train coaches, making me green with envy. Soon later another crowd of people got off at this station after the arrival.</p>
